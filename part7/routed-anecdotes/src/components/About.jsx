      <p>According to Wikipedia:</p>
  
      <blockquote>
        An anecdote is a brief, revealing account of an individual person or an incident. 
        Occasionally humorous, anecdotes differ from jokes because their primary purpose is 
        not simply to provoke laughter but to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself. 
        Anecdotes are "a story with a point."
